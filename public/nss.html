    <h2>NSS – National Service Scheme</h2>
    <h4>Not Me But You – Empowering Youth for Social Transformation</h4>
    <p>
      The National Service Scheme (NSS) at GHSS Kadayiruppu is a vibrant platform for students to participate in meaningful social service while pursuing their academic education. Established with the aim of creating socially responsible citizens, the NSS unit functions under the guiding principle of "Not Me, But You," instilling a deep sense of empathy, responsibility, and active citizenship in students.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through a wide spectrum of activities, our NSS unit promotes national integration, environmental awareness, public health, and human values. Students learn to engage with the community, identify real-life problems, and work collectively toward sustainable solutions. This hands-on exposure goes beyond classroom learning and fosters the spirit of teamwork, leadership, and compassion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The NSS volunteers at our school actively conduct cleanliness campaigns, plastic-free awareness drives, tree plantation programs, and road safety initiatives. They organize blood donation camps, assist the elderly, conduct surveys in rural areas, and collaborate with local authorities for public welfare activities. Their presence is felt in every corner of the school and in the surrounding community.
    </p>
    <p>
      The highlight of our NSS journey is the annual 7-day special residential camp. Held in an adopted village, this camp provides volunteers with a unique opportunity to serve the community through development projects such as building roads, constructing toilets, setting up libraries, and organizing health checkups. These camps include personality development sessions, leadership workshops, cultural activities, and interactive dialogues with social workers and government officials.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to these, the NSS unit takes active participation in national and international observance days such as World Environment Day, Independence Day, Constitution Day, Gandhi Jayanti, and International Yoga Day. Our volunteers also assist in disaster relief efforts and health awareness programs in collaboration with the local panchayat and NGOs.
