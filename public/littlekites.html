    <h2>Little Kites</h2>
    <h4>Empowering Young Minds with Digital Skills and Innovation</h4>
    <p>
      The <strong>Little Kites IT Club</strong> is Keralaâ€™s unique student-led digital initiative under the KITE (Kerala Infrastructure and Technology for Education) project. At GHSS Kadayiruppu, the Little Kites club plays a pioneering role in equipping students with 21st-century skills such as coding, animation, video editing, ethical hacking, robotics, and cyber safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Comprising talented students from Classes 8 to 12, our Little Kites unit is a vibrant space for digital creativity and problem-solving. The club functions as a collaborative hub where students are trained by mentors in advanced ICT skills. Members frequently attend workshops, coding boot camps, and awareness programs conducted in association with KITE and other government-approved tech bodies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our Little Kites team has created educational videos, edited short films, designed digital posters, and even contributed to the development of school-level apps and websites. They also participate in various state and district-level tech fests and competitions, consistently winning recognition for innovation and technical excellence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The club regularly conducts peer training programs, where student leaders help others in basic digital literacy, internet usage, file management, presentation tools, and the use of educational software. These peer-led workshops have created a strong digital culture among our students.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, Little Kites plays a crucial role in promoting cyber safety and responsible internet use. Through interactive sessions and digital awareness campaigns, students are made aware of the risks of online platforms and how to use them safely and ethically.
