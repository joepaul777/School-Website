    <h2>JRC</h2>
    <h4>Junior Red Cross</h4>
    <p>
      The Junior Red Cross (JRC) is a globally recognized youth movement guided by the principles of the Red Cross Society — humanity, impartiality, neutrality, independence, voluntary service, unity, and universality. At GHSS Kadayiruppu, our JRC unit stands as a beacon of compassion and humanitarian values, aiming to cultivate socially responsible and empathetic students from a young age.
    </p>
    <p>
      The club serves as a platform for students to learn about health, hygiene, disaster preparedness, and social service. Through workshops, seminars, and field activities, members are trained to respond effectively in times of need — whether it's administering first aid, organizing health check-up camps, or assisting during community emergencies. The spirit of JRC encourages students to see service as not just an act but a way of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Students actively participate in various awareness campaigns including blood donation drives, anti-drug movements, menstrual hygiene awareness, and environmental conservation. The club fosters leadership and teamwork through group tasks, mock drills, poster-making competitions, and street plays that educate the public on pressing social issues.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apart from health initiatives, JRC members are also involved in developing friendships across borders through letter exchanges and collaborative projects with JRC units from other states and countries, fostering peace and mutual understanding. The Red Cross Day is celebrated annually with vibrant programs, recognizing the contributions of student volunteers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Junior Red Cross of GHSS Kadayiruppu is not just a club — it is a mission. A mission to uplift communities, care for the vulnerable, and mold students into future leaders with a heart for humanity.
